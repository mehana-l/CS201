## Read in Data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(janitor)
```

```{r}
mtcars <- datasets::mtcars
```

```{r}
?mtcars
```

Lets examine the relationship between weight and miles per gallon.

```{r}
cars_wt_mpg <- ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt, point = model, color = hp)) +
geom_point() +
  labs(title = "weight to Miles per gallon",
    x = "Miles Per Galon",
        y = "Wieght of Vehicle")
cars_wt_mpg
```

you can also assign #label = model does the same as #point = model

```{r}
ggplotly(cars_wt_mpg)
```

How do we change it so that the row names are the collum names?

```{r}
mtcars <- mtcars %>%
  rownames_to_column("model")
```

#we have to runt he above script before we run our scatter plot because it changed the column name so we know what model car is coresponding to the point.
