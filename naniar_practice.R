#### dealing with missing data ####

# 1) drop missing values
# let's say we cared about mass & height. We wouldn't want to drop obsvs in pink, bc we'd lose valuable data
# we may want to drop row in blue

#### visualize missingness with scatterplots ####

  geom_miss_point() +
  theme_bw(base_size = 16) +

       caption = paste0("Source: ggplot2::starwars"))

ggplot(starwars, aes(x = mass, y = height)) +

  theme_bw(base_size = 16) +
  labs(title = "Height by Mass",
       caption = paste0("Source: ggplot2::starwars")) +
  facet_wrap(~gender)

## back to airquality
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Ozone, y = Solar.R)) +
  geom_point()
# we get a warning about missing values. they are removed and they aren't plotted! how do we fix it?

# solution

# facet by month
p1 <-
  ggplot(data = airquality,
         aes(x = Ozone,
             y = Solar.R)) + 
  geom_miss_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~Month, ncol = 2) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

p1

## make your own scatterplot of missing data using data of your choice. see if you can facet by another variable



#### data structures ####
# https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/naniar/versions/1.1.0
# The shadow matrix is the same dimension as the data, and consists of binary indicators of missingness of data values, where missing is represented as “NA”, and not missing is represented as “!NA”, and variable names are kept the same, with the added suffix “_NA” to the variables.

head(airquality, 10)
as_shadow(airquality)

# you can bind the shadow data to the data, to help you keep track of things. This is called "nabular"
bind_shadow(airquality) # these two do the same thing
nabular(airquality)

# using the nabular format helps you manage where missing values are in the df and make it easy to do viz where you split by missingness
airquality %>% 
  bind_shadow() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Temp, fill = Ozone_NA)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)

# can also help you visualize imputations
airquality %>%
  bind_shadow() %>%
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  simputation::impute_lm(Ozone ~ Temp + Solar.R) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Solar.R,
             y = Ozone,

#### statistical tests of missingnesss ####

# MCAR = missing completely at random. Missing data is completely random, unrelated to both observed and missing values.
# MAR = missing at random. Missing data is related to observed values (e.g., age in a survey about income), but not to the missing values (e.g., income). 
# MNAR = missing not at random. Missing data is related to the missing values themselves (e.g., people with high income not reporting their income).

# null hyp in this test is that the data is MCAR, and the test statistic is a chi-squared value.
# given the high statistic value and low p, we can conclude that the data is not MCAR
# high p = do not reject H0 = data IS MCAR
# low p = do reject H0 = data is not MCAR

mcar_test(diamonds) # reject with high confidence
mcar_test(starwars)
